## The Problem

<a href="http://clubs.marist.edu/band">The Marist College Band</a> plays every year in most of the school's basketball games. Previously students were required to participate in 50% of the games and were randomly assigned to games. They were either in the red band or white band. The problem with this is that students live busy lives and often ran into conflicts such as class or needing to go home for a couple of days.

## About The Project

This is a project created for <a href="http://clubs.marist.edu/band">The Marist College Band</a> which allows students to choose which basketball games they participate in. Students submit a form with their class times and games that they wish to play in. Students are then assigned to games based on instrumentation with their preferences in mind rather than randomly.
